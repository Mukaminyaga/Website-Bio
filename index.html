        Oprah Gail Winfrey,born January 29,1954, Kosciusko Mississippi, U.S.(age
        69),also known mononymously as Oprah, is an American talk show host,
        television producer, actress, author, and media proprietor.<br />
        She is best known for her talk show, The Oprah Winfrey Show, broadcast
        from Chicago, which ran in national syndication for 25 years, from 1986
        to 2011.<br />
        Dubbed the "Queen of All Media",she was the richest African-American of
        the 20th century and was once the world's only black billionaire. By
        2007, she was often ranked as the most influential woman in the
        world.<br />Winfrey was born into poverty in rural Mississippi to a
        single teenage mother and later raised in inner-city Milwaukee. She has
        stated that she was molested during her childhood and early teenage
        years and became pregnant at 14; her son was born prematurely and died
        in infancy.<br />
        Winfrey was then sent to live with the man she calls her father, Vernon
        Winfrey, a barber in Nashville, Tennessee, and landed a job in radio
        while still in high school. By 19, she was a co-anchor for the local
        evening news. Winfrey's often emotional, extemporaneous delivery
        eventually led to her transfer to the daytime talk show arena, and after
        boosting a third-rated local Chicago talk show to first place,she
        launched her own production company.
