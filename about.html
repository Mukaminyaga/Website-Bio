      <h1>The Oprah Effect</h1>
      <p>
        The power of Winfrey's opinions and endorsement to influence public
        opinion, especially consumer purchasing choices, has been dubbed "the
        Oprah Effect".[185] <br />The effect has been documented or alleged in
        domains as diverse as book sales, beef markets, and election voting.
        Late in 1996,[186] Winfrey introduced the Oprah's Book Club segment to
        her television show. The segment focused on new books and classics and
        often brought obscure novels to popular attention. <br />The book club
        became such a powerful force that whenever Winfrey introduced a new book
        as her book-club selection, it instantly became a best-seller; for
        example, when she selected the classic John Steinbeck novel East of
        Eden, it soared to the top of the book charts. Being recognized by
        Winfrey often means a million additional book sales for an author.[187]
        In Reading with Oprah: The Book Club that Changed America (2005),
        Kathleen Rooney describes Winfrey as "a serious American intellectual
        who pioneered the use of electronic media, specifically television and
        the Internet, to take reading a decidedly non-technological and highly
        individual act and highlight its social elements and uses in such a way
        to motivate millions of erstwhile non-readers to pick up books."

        The viewership for The Oprah Winfrey Show was highest during the 1991–92
        season, when about 13.1 million U.S. viewers were watching each day. By
        2003, ratings declined to 7.4 million daily viewers.[255] Ratings
        briefly rebounded to approximately 9 million in 2005 and then declined
        again to around 7.3 million viewers in 2008, though it remained the
        highest-rated talk show.[256]<br />
        In 2008, Winfrey's show was airing in 140 countries internationally and
        seen by an estimated 46 million people in the US weekly.[257][258]
        According to the Harris poll, Winfrey was America's favorite television
        personality in 1998, 2000, 2002–06, and 2009. Winfrey was especially
        popular among women, Democrats, political moderates, Baby Boomers,
        Generation X, Southern Americans, and East Coast Americans.[259]
        <br />Outside the U.S., Winfrey has become increasingly popular in the
        Arab world. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2007 that MBC 4, an Arab
        satellite channel, centered its entire programming around reruns of her
        show because it was drawing record numbers of female viewers in Saudi
        Arabia.[260] In 2008, The New York Times reported that The Oprah Winfrey
        Show, with Arabic subtitles, was broadcast twice each weekday on MBC 4.
        Winfrey's modest dress, combined with her attitude of triumph over
        adversity and abuse has caused some women in Saudi Arabia to idealize
        her.[261]

        In 2004, Winfrey became the first black person to rank among the 50 most
        generous Americans[262] and she remained among the top 50 until
        2010.[263] By 2012, she had given away about $400 million to educational
        causes.[264]<br />
        As of 2012, Winfrey had also given over 400 scholarships to Morehouse
        College in Atlanta, Georgia.[148] Winfrey was the recipient of the first
        Bob Hope Humanitarian Award at the 2002 Emmy Awards for services to
        television and film. To celebrate two decades on national TV, and to
        thank her employees for their hard work, Winfrey took her staff and
        their families (1,065 people in total) on vacation to Hawaii in the
        summer of 2006.[265] <br />In 2013, Winfrey donated $12 million to the
        Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and
        Culture.[266] President Barack Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal
        of Freedom later that same year.[267]

    <section id="angel network">
      <h1>Oprah's Angel Network</h1>
      <p>
        In 1998, Winfrey created Oprah's Angel Network, a charity that supported
        charitable projects and provided grants to nonprofit organizations
        around the world. Oprah's Angel Network raised more than $80 million ($1
        million of which was donated by Jon Bon Jovi). Winfrey personally
        covered all administrative costs associated with the charity, so 100% of
        all funds raised went to charity programs. In May 2010, with Oprah's
        show ending, the charity stopped accepting donations and was shut
        down.[268][269]
